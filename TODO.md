#To do
Updated 6-18-20

###Priority 0 (breaks the program):
* Write pipeline to accomodate non-overlapping paired reads

###Priority 1 (necessary features to add):
* Altered heatmap color scheme (white - red for editing rate)
* Set dynamic sample filtering by statistical power

###Priority 2 (improve performance):
* Make option to bypass post-alignment filtering by setting filters at the alignment level
* Concurrent filtering, library assignment, and editing quantification
* Single library construction for multiple sample quantification

###Priority 3 (optional features to add):
* Dynamic filtering (remove mutations that occur frequently (synthesis), but allow singleton errors (sequencing))
* Track editing rates for non-library mutations
* Automatically calculate position parameter

###Priority 4 (improve style):
* Write docstrings
* Comment code
* Write documentation
* Remove deprecated or unused methods and functions
