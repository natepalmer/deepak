#To do
Updated 11-4-19

###Priority 0 (breaks the program):
* Write methods to quantify editing from csv output data rather than analysis pickled objects
* Restructure code to improve readability, robustness, versatility, modularity, and performance

###Priority 1 (necessary features to add):
* Altered heatmap color scheme (white - red for editing rate)
* Set dynamic sample filtering by statistical power

###Priority 2 (improve performance):
* Make option to bypass post-alignment filtering by setting filters at the alignment level
* Concurrent filtering, library assignment, and editing quantification to improve performance
* Single library construction for multiple sample quantification

###Priority 3 (optional features to add):
* Dynamic filtering (remove mutations that occur frequently (synthesis), but allow singleton errors (sequencing))
* Track editing rates for non-library mutations

###Priority 4 (improve style):
* Write docstrings
* Comment code
* Write documentation
